   - Consider experience levels and background knowledge
   - Provide both high-level overviews and detailed information

3. **Visual Elements**
   - Use diagrams, flowcharts, and screenshots where they enhance understanding
   - Maintain consistency in visual style
   - Keep visuals up-to-date with code changes

4. **Documentation Accessibility**
   - Ensure documentation is easily discoverable
   - Organize documentation logically
   - Use cross-references and links between related documents

5. **Tool Integration**
   - Leverage documentation generation tools
   - Integrate documentation into IDEs and workflow tools
   - Automate documentation checks where possible

## Examples

### Good Class Documentation Example

```java
/**
 * Manages user authentication and session handling for the application.
 * <p>
 * The UserAuthManager is responsible for authenticating users against the 
 * database, creating and validating session tokens, and handling login/logout
 * operations. It implements security best practices including password hashing,
 * rate limiting, and session timeout.
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe and can be used as a singleton.
 * 
 * @author Jane Smith
 * @since 1.2.0
 */
public class UserAuthManager {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Good Method Documentation Example

```javascript
/**
 * Processes a payment transaction using the specified payment provider.
 * 
 * This method handles the complete payment flow including validation,
 * processing, and recording the transaction. It communicates with the
 * payment gateway and handles error conditions appropriately.
 * 
 * @param {Object} paymentDetails - The payment details
 * @param {string} paymentDetails.amount - The payment amount (decimal string)
 * @param {string} paymentDetails.currency - The 3-letter currency code (e.g., "USD")
 * @param {string} paymentDetails.cardToken - The tokenized card information
 * @param {string} paymentDetails.customerId - The customer's unique identifier
 * @param {Object} [options] - Optional configuration for the payment
 * @param {boolean} [options.captureImmediately=true] - Whether to capture the payment immediately
 * @param {string} [options.provider="default"] - The payment provider to use
 * 
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} A promise that resolves to the transaction result
 * @throws {ValidationError} If the payment details are invalid
 * @throws {PaymentGatewayError} If the payment provider returns an error
 * @throws {DatabaseError} If the transaction cannot be recorded
 * 
 * @example
 * // Process a standard payment
 * const result = await processPayment({
 *   amount: "99.95",
 *   currency: "USD",
 *   cardToken: "tok_visa_4242",
 *   customerId: "cust_123456"
 * });
 * 
 * // Process with custom options
 * const result = await processPayment({
 *   amount: "99.95",
 *   currency: "EUR",
 *   cardToken: "tok_visa_4242",
 *   customerId: "cust_123456"
 * }, {
 *   captureImmediately: false,
 *   provider: "stripe"
 * });
 */
async function processPayment(paymentDetails, options = {}) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Good Architecture Documentation Example

```markdown
# Payment Processing Architecture

## Overview

The payment processing system handles all financial transactions in the application.
It is designed to be secure, reliable, and extensible to support multiple payment
providers. The system follows PCI-DSS compliance requirements and implements 
industry best practices for financial data security.

## Components

1. **Payment Gateway Interface**: Abstracts communication with various payment providers
2. **Transaction Manager**: Handles the lifecycle of payment transactions
3. **Fraud Detection Service**: Evaluates transactions for potential fraud
4. **Payment Data Store**: Securely stores transaction records
5. **Notification Service**: Sends payment notifications to users and administrators

## Data Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Customer] -->|Submits payment| B[Web Application]
    B -->|Validates and tokenizes| C[Payment Controller]
    C -->|Processes payment| D[Transaction Manager]
    D -->|Communicates with provider| E[Payment Gateway Interface]
    E -->|Sends request| F[External Payment Provider]
    F -->|Returns result| E
    E -->|Returns status| D
    D -->|Stores record| G[Payment Data Store]
    D -->|Fraud check| H[Fraud Detection Service]
    D -->|Sends notification| I[Notification Service]
    I -->|Emails receipt| A
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Tokenization**: We use tokenization to ensure no sensitive payment data is stored in our systems
2. **Provider Abstraction**: The gateway interface allows easy integration of new payment providers
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running operations use queues to ensure reliability
4. **Idempotency**: All payment operations are idempotent to prevent duplicate transactions
