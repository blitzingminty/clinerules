## Critical Flows

### Payment Processing Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Customer
    participant A as API Gateway
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant V as Validator
    participant P as Processor
    participant G as Gateway
    participant DB as Database
    participant E as Event Bus
    participant N as Notifications

    C->>A: Submit payment request
    A->>O: Forward request
    O->>V: Validate request
    V->>O: Validation result
    
    alt is valid
        O->>P: Process payment

        O->>E: Publish validation failure
        E->>N: Trigger notification
        N->>C: Send failure notice
    end
```

## Data Model

### Transaction Entity

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Transaction {
        +UUID id
        +String referenceId
        +UUID customerId
        +Money amount
        +Currency currency
        +PaymentMethod paymentMethod
        +TransactionStatus status
        +DateTime createdAt
        +DateTime updatedAt
        +Map~String,String~ metadata
        +process() TransactionResult
        +void cancel()
        +void refund()
    }
    
    class TransactionResult {
        +UUID transactionId
        +boolean successful
        +String gatewayReference
        +ErrorCode errorCode
        +String errorMessage
    }
    
    Transaction --> TransactionResult
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization

The Payment Processing Service implements the following security measures:

1. **API Authentication**:
   - OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
   - Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
   - API keys for partner integrations

2. **Authorization Model**:
   - Role-based access control with the following roles:
     - `payment.read`: Can view transaction details
     - `payment.process`: Can initiate new transactions
     - `payment.refund`: Can issue refunds
     - `payment.admin`: Can manage configurations

3. **Data Security**:
   - All PII and card data is encrypted at rest using AES-256
   - Sensitive data in transit is protected with TLS 1.3
   - Payment card data is tokenized and never stored directly
   - Encryption keys are rotated quarterly using automated key management

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput and Latency

The service is designed to handle the following performance requirements:

- **Peak throughput**: 5,000 transactions per second
- **Average latency**: < 300ms for 95th percentile
- **Maximum latency**: < 1s for 99.9th percentile

Performance testing results from the most recent tests:

| Scenario | Load | Avg. Latency | 95th % | 99th % | Error Rate |
|----------|------|--------------|--------|--------|------------|
| Normal | 1,000 TPS | 120ms | 180ms | 220ms | 0.001% |
| Peak | 5,000 TPS | 250ms | 450ms | 800ms | 0.01% |
| Stress | 7,500 TPS | 400ms | 850ms | 1.2s | 0.1% |

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: Payment Gateway Abstraction Layer

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We need to integrate with multiple payment gateways to provide redundancy and support various payment methods.

**Decision**: Implement an abstraction layer using the Adapter pattern to decouple core payment processing from specific gateway implementations.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Can add new gateways without changing core logic
- Positive: Can switch gateways for specific payments based on rules
- Negative: Adds complexity to the codebase
- Negative: Lowest common denominator effect for gateway-specific features

**Implementation Notes**: Each gateway adapter must implement the `PaymentGateway` interface and handle gateway-specific error mapping.
```

### Comprehensive Method Documentation Example

```java
/**
 * Processes a payment transaction through the specified payment gateway.
 * <p>
 * This method handles the entire payment processing flow including validation,
 * gateway communication, error handling, retry logic, and transaction recording.
 * It ensures that transactions are atomic and consistent even in the case of
 * partial failures by implementing a two-phase commit pattern with the
 * transaction database and payment gateway.
 * <p>
 * The method is idempotent and can be safely retried with the same transactionId
 * without resulting in duplicate charges. If a transaction with the given ID
 * already exists, the method will return the existing result rather than
 * processing again.
 * <p>
 * Performance note: This method typically completes in 300-500ms but may take
 * up to 2000ms during peak processing times or when gateway latency is high.
 * Callers should set appropriate timeouts.
 *
 * @param transactionRequest The payment transaction request containing all necessary
 *                          details for processing the payment. Must not be null.
 *                          All required fields must be populated according to the
 *                          {@link TransactionRequest} documentation.
 * @param gatewayType The payment gateway to use for processing. Must be one of
 *                   the supported gateways defined in {@link GatewayType}.
 *                   If null, the default gateway will be selected based on the
 *                   payment method and transaction properties.
 * @param options Additional processing options that modify the behavior of the
 *               payment processing. Optional, may be null to use default behavior.
 *               See {@link PaymentOptions} for available options.
 *
 * @return A {@link TransactionResult} object containing the complete result of
 *         the transaction, including gateway reference ID, status, and any
 *         error information. Never returns null.
 *
 * @throws ValidationException If the transaction request is invalid or missing
 *                            required fields. The exception will contain detailed
 *                            information about which validations failed.
 * @throws GatewayException If communication with the payment gateway fails or the
 *                         gateway returns an unrecoverable error. Contains the
 *                         specific gateway error code and message.
 * @throws PaymentDeclinedException If the payment was declined by the gateway or
 *                                 issuing bank. Contains the decline code and
 *                                 reason if available.
 * @throws DuplicateTransactionException If a transaction with the same external
 *                                      reference ID has already been processed
 *                                      and the current request differs from the
 *                                      original.
 * @throws SystemException If an unexpected internal error occurs during processing.
 *
 * @implNote This implementation uses the Strategy pattern to select the appropriate
 *          gateway handler, and a Circuit Breaker pattern to handle gateway outages.
 *          The method is annotated with @Transactional to ensure database consistency.
 *
 * @see TransactionRequest
 * @see GatewayType
 * @see PaymentOptions
 * @see TransactionResult
 *
 * @security This method requires the caller to have the 'payment.process' permission.
 *          All PAN data is tokenized before storage and all sensitive data is
 *          encrypted in logs.
 *
 * @example
 * // Process a simple credit card payment
 * try {
 *     TransactionRequest request = new TransactionRequest.Builder()
 *         .withAmount(new Money("99.95", Currency.USD))
 *         .withPaymentMethod(new CreditCardPaymentMethod("4111111111111111", "12/25", "123"))
 *         .withCustomerId("cust_12345")
 *         .withMerchantReference("order_8654")
 *         .build();
 *     
 *     TransactionResult result = paymentService.processTransaction(request, GatewayType.STRIPE, null);
 *     
 *     if (result.isSuccessful()) {
 *         // Handle successful payment
 *         String gatewayReference = result.getGatewayReference();
 *         // Store gateway reference with order
 *     } else {
 *         // Handle declined payment
 *         DeclineReason reason = result.getDeclineReason();
 *         // Inform user of decline reason
 *     }
 * } catch (ValidationException e) {
 *     // Handle validation errors
 *     List<ValidationError> errors = e.getValidationErrors();
 *     // Display errors to user
 * } catch (GatewayException e) {
 *     // Handle gateway communication errors
 *     // Typically retry or switch to backup gateway
 *     logFailure("Gateway error", e);
 *     switchToBackupGateway();
 * }

 *         .withCustomerId("cust_12345")
 *         .withMerchantReference("order_8654")
 *         .build();
 *     
 *     PaymentOptions options = new PaymentOptions.Builder()
 *         .withCapture(false) // Authorize only, capture later
 *         .withStatement("ACME Store Purchase") // Custom statement descriptor
 *         .withMetadata(Map.of("orderSystem", "ecommerce", "promotion", "SUMMER2025"))
 *         .withIdempotencyKey("idem_12345") // Custom idempotency key
 *         .withRetryCount(3) // Override default retry count
 *         .build();
 *     
 *     TransactionResult result = paymentService.processTransaction(
 *         request, GatewayType.STRIPE, options);
