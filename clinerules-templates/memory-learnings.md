## Learning: Effective State Management in React
**ID:** 2025-03-15-01  
**Category:** Frontend Development

### Learning
Using React Context API with useReducer hook provides better state management for complex applications than useState for shared state across multiple components.

### Context
When implementing the user dashboard, state management became complex with multiple nested components needing access to and ability to update the same state.

### Solution/Implementation
Implemented a context-based state management approach:

```javascript
// UserStateContext.js
import React, { createContext, useReducer, useContext } from 'react';

const UserContext = createContext();

const initialState = {
  profile: null,
  preferences: {},
  notifications: []
};

function userReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_PROFILE':
      return { ...state, profile: action.payload };
    case 'UPDATE_PREFERENCES':
      return { ...state, preferences: { ...state.preferences, ...action.payload } };
    case 'ADD_NOTIFICATION':
      return { ...state, notifications: [...state.notifications, action.payload] };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

export function UserProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(userReducer, initialState);
  
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useUserState() {
  return useContext(UserContext);
}
```

### Benefits
- Eliminated prop drilling through multiple component layers
- Centralized state logic in a single location
- Made state updates more predictable with action types
- Improved component reusability and testability

## Learning: Optimizing Database Queries
**ID:** 2025-03-10-02  
**Category:** Backend Performance

### Learning
Using database indexing and query optimization techniques reduced API response times by 75% for large data sets.

### Context
User list page was experiencing slow load times (>3s) when pagination was implemented with large data sets (>10,000 records).

### Solution/Implementation
1. Added composite index on frequently queried and sorted columns
2. Implemented eager loading of related entities
3. Optimized WHERE clauses to use indexed fields

```sql
-- Before
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY last_login DESC LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40;

-- After
CREATE INDEX idx_users_last_login ON users(last_login);
SELECT id, username, email, last_login FROM users ORDER BY last_login DESC LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40;
```

### Benefits
- Reduced query execution time from 2.5s to 150ms
- Improved user experience with faster page loads
- Reduced server load during peak usage periods

## Learning: Accessibility Implementation
**ID:** 2025-03-05-03  
**Category:** Frontend Accessibility

### Learning
Implementing ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation significantly improved application accessibility for screen reader users without compromising the visual design.

### Context
Accessibility audit revealed that the form components were not properly accessible to screen reader users and keyboard navigation was inconsistent.

### Solution/Implementation
1. Added appropriate ARIA labels and roles
2. Implemented focus management
3. Added keyboard shortcuts for common actions

```html
<!-- Before -->
<div class="form-group">
  <input type="text" class="form-input" />
  <span class="error-message">This field is required</span>
</div>

<!-- After -->
<div class="form-group">
  <label id="name-label" for="name-input">Name</label>
  <input 
    type="text" 
    id="name-input"
    class="form-input" 
    aria-labelledby="name-label"
    aria-describedby="name-error"
    aria-invalid="true"
  />
  <span id="name-error" class="error-message" role="alert">
    This field is required
  </span>
</div>
```

### Benefits
- Made the application usable for users with screen readers
- Improved overall UX for keyboard users
- Met WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
