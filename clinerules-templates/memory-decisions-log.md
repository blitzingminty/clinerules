## Decision: Adopt TypeScript for Frontend Development
**ID:** 2025-03-18-01  
**Title:** Adopt TypeScript for Frontend Development  
**Category:** Technology Stack

### Decision
Adopt TypeScript as the primary language for all frontend development, replacing plain JavaScript.

### Status
Accepted

### Context
The project was experiencing an increasing number of type-related bugs and runtime errors in the frontend. As the application grew in complexity, the lack of static typing was causing maintenance challenges and reducing developer productivity.

### Options Considered

1. **Continue with JavaScript + JSDoc comments**
   - Pros: No significant change to existing workflow; no learning curve
   - Cons: Limited type checking; inconsistent adoption of JSDoc; type information not enforced

2. **Adopt TypeScript**
   - Pros: Static typing; better IDE support; improved maintainability; catch errors at build time
   - Cons: Learning curve for some team members; initial productivity slowdown; migration effort for existing code

3. **Adopt Flow**
   - Pros: Less intrusive than TypeScript; can be adopted incrementally
   - Cons: Smaller community and ecosystem than TypeScript; less robust tooling support

### Decision Rationale
TypeScript was chosen because it offers the most robust type system, has excellent tooling support, and has become an industry standard for large-scale JavaScript applications. The initial investment in learning and migration is expected to be offset by improved maintainability, fewer runtime bugs, and better developer productivity in the medium to long term.

### Implementation
We will implement this decision in phases:

1. Set up TypeScript configuration for the project
2. Create type definitions for shared interfaces and APIs
3. Write all new components in TypeScript
4. Gradually migrate existing components, starting with the most critical ones

```typescript
// Example TypeScript implementation
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}

interface UserPreferences {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
  notifications: boolean;
  language: string;
}

function getUserDisplayName(user: User): string {
  return user.name || user.email.split('@')[0];
}
```

### Consequences
- Improved code quality and reduced runtime errors
- Better developer experience with improved autocompletion and navigation
- Slight learning curve for team members new to TypeScript
- Short-term decrease in development velocity during the transition
- Need for ongoing type maintenance as the codebase evolves

## Decision: Implement JWT Authentication Strategy
**ID:** 2025-03-12-02  
**Title:** Implement JWT Authentication Strategy  
**Category:** Security

### Decision
Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization across the application, with a short-lived access token and a longer-lived refresh token strategy.

### Status
Accepted

### Context
The application needed a secure, scalable authentication solution that works well with our microservices architecture and single-page application frontend. The previous session-based authentication was causing issues with scaling and cross-domain requests.

### Options Considered

1. **Session-based Authentication**
   - Pros: Simple to implement; well-understood; directly revocable
   - Cons: Requires session storage; issues with scaling; problematic for APIs and cross-domain requests

2. **JWT Authentication (Access + Refresh Tokens)**
   - Pros: Stateless; works well with microservices; no server storage needed for validation; supports cross-domain
   - Cons: More complex implementation; token size considerations; requires secure token handling

3. **OAuth 2.0 with third-party provider**
   - Pros: Delegate authentication responsibility; standardized protocol
   - Cons: External dependency; account linkage complexity; potential vendor lock-in

### Decision Rationale
JWT was selected because it provides a stateless authentication mechanism that aligns with our microservices architecture. The combination of short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) and longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days) balances security and user experience. This approach eliminates the need for server-side session storage while still providing a mechanism to revoke access when needed.

### Implementation
The implementation includes:

1. Access tokens valid for 15 minutes
2. Refresh tokens valid for 7 days, stored in HTTP-only cookies
3. Token rotation on refresh for additional security
4. Blacklisting mechanism for revoked refresh tokens

```javascript
// Example JWT generation
const generateTokens = (userId) => {
  const accessToken = jwt.sign(
    { userId, type: 'access' },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '15m' }
  );
  
  const refreshToken = jwt.sign(
    { userId, type: 'refresh', tokenVersion: user.tokenVersion },
    process.env.JWT_REFRESH_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '7d' }
  );
  
  return { accessToken, refreshToken };
};
```

### Consequences
- Improved scalability with stateless authentication
- Better security with short-lived access tokens
- More complex implementation and token management
- Need for secure token storage on the client
- Additional complexity for token revocation

## Decision: Move to Microservices Architecture
**ID:** 2025-03-05-03  
**Title:** Move to Microservices Architecture  
**Category:** System Architecture

### Decision
Migrate from the current monolithic application architecture to a microservices architecture, with services aligned to business domains.

### Status
Accepted

### Context
As the application has grown, the monolithic architecture has led to:
- Deployment challenges and risk
- Development bottlenecks as teams need to coordinate changes
- Difficulty scaling individual components of the system
- Technology constraints forcing uniform choices across different functional areas

### Options Considered

1. **Maintain and Refactor Monolith**
   - Pros: Lower initial effort; avoid distributed systems complexity; simpler operations
   - Cons: Doesn't address scaling or deployment issues; limits technology choices

2. **Modular Monolith**
   - Pros: Better code organization; potential stepping stone to microservices; less operational complexity
   - Cons: Still has deployment coupling; partial solution to scaling issues

3. **Full Microservices Architecture**
   - Pros: Independent scaling; technology flexibility; team autonomy; targeted deployments
   - Cons: Distributed systems complexity; operational overhead; potential performance impacts

4. **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern**
   - Pros: Optimized APIs for different clients; partial decoupling
   - Cons: Still requires backend services architecture decision; additional layer

### Decision Rationale
The microservices approach was chosen to address the specific scaling, deployment, and team autonomy challenges we're facing. By aligning services with business domains, we can enable teams to work independently, deploy more frequently with lower risk, and scale components based on their specific requirements.

### Implementation
We will implement the transition gradually:

1. Identify service boundaries based on business domains
2. Implement API gateway as entry point
3. Extract services one by one, starting with the most independent ones
4. Introduce event-based communication for cross-service integration

### Consequences
- Improved scalability for individual components
- More frequent, lower-risk deployments
- Team autonomy and technology flexibility
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for service discovery, monitoring, and distributed tracing
- Potential performance overhead from service communication
