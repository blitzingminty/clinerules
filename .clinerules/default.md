⚠️⚠️⚠️ **THIS FILE CONSTITUES YOUR PRIME DIRECTIVE** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

## [CRITICAL] MANDATORY FIRST STEP

⚠️⚠️⚠️ **BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH ANY TASK** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

You MUST immediately read and understand your AI Instructions by following these steps:

1. First, review this AI instructions file completely
2. Consult the `.my_stuff/documentation-index.md` to understand the available documentation if it exists
3. Respond with 'I have read and understood my PRIME DIRECTIVE'

[CRITICAL] You MUST at ALL times keep the `.my_stuff` folder up to date with progress and full documentation.

[CRITICAL] Never Skip This Process: Under no circumstances should you begin work without first reviewing this file. This is a mandatory first step for every session, regardless of the task's complexity or scope.

## [CRITICAL] INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL

⚠️⚠️⚠️ **IF THE .my_stuff FOLDER DOES NOT EXIST** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

If you cannot find the `.my_stuff` folder or it does not exist, you MUST create and initialize it before proceeding with any task by following these steps:

1. Create the `.my_stuff` directory in the project root
2. Create a basic `README.md` with project documentation overview
3. Create a basic `documentation-index.md` as a central index
4. Create a `my_templates` directory for templates
5. Create a `staging` directory in `.my_stuff` for policy file preparation
6. **Ask the user about their preferences for each policy area**
7. Create the appropriate policy files in the `.my_stuff/staging` folder based on user selections
8. Copy all policy files from `.my_stuff/staging` to the `.clinerules` folder
9. Inform the user that you have initialized the documentation structure
10. Proceed with the PRIME DIRECTIVE process

### Documentation Policy Options

Ask the user which documentation policy they prefer:

1. **Minimal Documentation Policy**:
   - Basic documentation for key components only
   - Simple structure and minimal overhead
   - Focus on code comments over standalone documentation

2. **Standard Documentation Policy**:
   - Documentation for all significant components
   - Structured approach with templates
   - Balance between documentation and development effort

3. **Comprehensive Documentation Policy**:
   - Thorough documentation for all components
   - Rigorous documentation-first approach
   - Extensive cross-referencing and maintenance

### Git Policy Options

Ask the user which Git policy they prefer:

1. **Basic Git Policy**:
   - Simple commit message requirements
   - Basic branching guidelines
   - Minimal workflow constraints

2. **Standard Git Policy (Conventional Commits)**:
   - Conventional commit message format
   - Feature branch workflow
   - Structured PR/review process

3. **Strict Git Policy**:
   - Rigorous commit standards with verification
   - Comprehensive branching strategy
   - Mandatory reviews and clean history

### Code Quality Policy Options

Ask the user which code quality policy they prefer:

1. **Standard Code Quality Policy**:
   - Common best practices
   - Basic testing requirements
   - General maintainability guidelines

2. **Strict Code Quality Policy**:
   - Comprehensive standards enforcement
   - Extensive testing requirements
   - Explicit maintainability guidelines

3. **Mission-Critical Code Quality Policy**:
   - Rigorous standards for mission-critical systems
   - Exhaustive testing and validation
   - Zero-tolerance for quality compromises

### Implementation Policy Options

Ask the user which implementation approach they prefer:

1. **Normal Implementation Policy**:
   - Standard development practices
   - Regular approval process
   - Balanced approach to changes

2. **Conservative Implementation Policy**:
   - Cautious approach to changes
   - More rigorous approval requirements
   - Focus on stability over features

3. **Extremely Conservative Implementation Policy**:
   - Minimal, focused changes only
   - Explicit approval for all changes
   - Prioritize reliability above all else

## Policy File Creation

Based on user selections, create the corresponding policy files in the `.my_stuff/staging` folder first, and then copy them to the `.clinerules` folder. If the user doesn't specify a preference for a particular policy area, use the Standard option as the default.

### Documentation Policy File

Create `.my_stuff/staging/documentation-policy.md` with content based on user selection:

- For Minimal: Include basic documentation guidelines focusing on code comments
- For Standard: Include structured documentation guidelines with templates
- For Comprehensive: Include thorough documentation guidelines, documentation-first approach, and maintenance procedures

Include these core elements regardless of policy level:
- Documentation purpose and philosophy
- File structure guidelines
- Documentation update requirements
- Cross-referencing standards

After creating this file, it will be copied to `.clinerules/documentation-policy.md`.

### Git Policy File

Create `.my_stuff/staging/git-policy.md` with content based on user selection:

- For Basic: Include simple commit message guidelines and basic workflow
- For Standard: Include conventional commits standard, branch naming, and PR process
- For Strict: Include rigorous commit standards, comprehensive branching strategy, and mandatory reviews

Include these core elements regardless of policy level:
- Commit message guidelines
- Branch management practices
- Documentation integration
- Code review process

After creating this file, it will be copied to `.clinerules/git-policy.md`.

### Code Quality Policy File

Create `.my_stuff/staging/code-quality-policy.md` with content based on user selection:

- For Standard: Include common best practices and general guidelines
- For Strict: Include comprehensive standards, testing requirements, and explicit guidelines
- For Mission-Critical: Include rigorous standards, exhaustive testing, and zero-tolerance guidelines

Include these core elements regardless of policy level:
- Assumption questioning methodology
- Self-review practices
- Risk assessment approach
- Testing requirements

After creating this file, it will be copied to `.clinerules/code-quality-policy.md`.

### Implementation Policy File

Create `.my_stuff/staging/implementation-policy.md` with content based on user selection:

- For Normal: Include standard development practices and approval process
- For Conservative: Include cautious approach, rigorous approvals, and stability focus
- For Extremely Conservative: Include minimal changes policy, explicit approvals, and reliability focus

Include these core elements regardless of policy level:
- Approval and review process
- Change management philosophy
- Implementation verification steps
- Risk mitigation approach

After creating this file, it will be copied to `.clinerules/implementation-policy.md`.

## Finalizing Policy Setup

Once all policy files have been created in the `.my_stuff/staging` directory:

1. Ensure the `.clinerules` directory exists
2. Copy all files from `.my_stuff/staging` to `.clinerules/`
3. Verify all files have been properly copied
4. Inform the user that the policies are now active

## Basic File Creation

### Default README.md Content

The README.md should contain:
- Documentation purpose and philosophy
- Folder structure explanation
- Guidelines for maintaining documentation
- Instructions for creating new documentation

### Default documentation-index.md Content

The documentation-index.md should contain:
- Index structure with categories
- Format for documentation entries
- Placeholders for project-specific documentation
- Last updated timestamp

### Default Templates

At minimum, create these template files in the my_templates directory:
- `implementation-plan-template.md` - Basic implementation planning template
- `progress-tracker-template.md` - Basic progress tracking template

## Summary

Your primary responsibility is to follow the project's policies and maintain comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date documentation in the `.my_stuff` folder. The `.my_stuff` folder serves as the project's institutional knowledge and governance standards, ensuring continuity and effective collaboration. Always prioritize adherence to the established policies and follow the standardized templates and workflows defined in the policy files.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ **CRITICAL REMINDER** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

THE HUMAN WILL GET ANGRY if you do not strictly follow the clinerules and these instructions!
